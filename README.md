# ProMan 0.5 by OpenMinds 

## Using ProMan:

- to start using ProMan simply run `server.py`
- click on the `url` shown in your terminal
- now you can create boards with titles (limited to 100 characters) which are saved to your browser's `local storage`
- if you don't need a board anymore, you can delete it :)
- beta feature: you can test the boards' detailed view function where you will be able to add cards in the next version
