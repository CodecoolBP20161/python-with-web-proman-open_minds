# ProMan 1.0 by OpenMinds

## Using ProMan:

- on first start run `build.py` to create the database
- to use ProMan run  `server.py`
- `ctrl+click` on the `url` shown in your terminal
- now you can create boards and cards on them
- both of the boards and cards you can give title and details which are saved to a Postgres database on your computer
- if you don't need a board or a card anymore, you can delete it :) (beware: deleting a board deletes all cards on it!)
